# Memory Game Project
Welcome to the Memory Game project! This project was created as a learning exercise in JavaScript, aimed at solidifying the understanding of core concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic.

## Description
The Memory Game is a classic card-matching game where the player's objective is to find all pairs of matching cards within a deck. Cards are initially placed face down, and the player flips them over, two at a time, trying to find matching pairs. The game ends when all pairs have been found.

## Features
Dynamic generation of a deck of cards
Interactive gameplay with card-flipping functionality
Tracking of game progress, including the number of moves made and time taken
Interactive congratulations modal upon completing the game.

## Technologies Used
HTML/CSS: Provides the structure and styling for the game interface.
JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including card shuffling, flipping, and matching.
Bootstrap: Utilized for responsive design and styling elements of the game.

## Getting Started
To run the Memory Game locally on your machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

## How to Play
1. Click on any card to reveal its symbol.
2. Click on a second card to try to find its matching pair.
3. If the cards match, they remain face up. If not, they flip back over.
4. Continue flipping pairs of cards until all pairs are matched.
